# ‚åöÔ∏è Biratime ZSH theme

A simple [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) theme based on the [Bira theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme). The username has been replaced by the time in 24h format, as we usually don't need to be reminded on which machine and user we are logged in at every key stroke. But it can be helpful to keep track of time within the terminal.

The color of the time changes from blue to red if you are logged with a user that is not UID `1000`, as the user with UID `1000` is usually the 1st user to be created on the machine, and used as main user. This helps to quickly know when you are logged in with a special user, such as root.

## üñºÔ∏è What it looks like

Here is what the theme looks like in a Gnome Terminal with the [solarized colors scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) enabled.
