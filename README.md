# ‚åöÔ∏è Biratime ZSH theme

A simple [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) theme based on the [Bira theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme). The username has been replaced by the time in 24h format, as we usually don't need to be reminded on which machine and user we are logged in at every key stroke. But it can be helpful to keep track of time within the terminal.

The color of the time changes from blue to red if you are logged with a user that is not UID `1000`, as the user with UID `1000` is usually the 1st user to be created on the machine, and used as main user. This helps to quickly know when you are logged in with a special user, such as root.

## üñºÔ∏è What it looks like

Here is what the theme looks like in a Gnome Terminal with the [solarized colors scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) enabled.

## üì•Ô∏è Quick installation

<details><summary>You will need to have the <code>ZSH</code> shell installed.</summary>
```bash
# On Debian-based Linux
sudo apt install -y zsh
# On RedHat Linux
sudo dnf install -y zsh
# On MacOS
brew install zsh
```

</details>

Run the script to install the theme:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/vemonet/biratime/main/install.sh)"
```

## üïµÔ∏è Detailed installation

1. **Install [Oh My ZSH!](https://ohmyz.sh)**

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```


2. **Download the theme**:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/biratime.zsh-theme https://raw.github.com/vemonet/biratime/main/biratime.zsh-theme
```

3. **Enable the theme** and `virtualenv` plugin by editing your `~/.zshrc` config file:

```bash
sed -i 's/^ZSH_THEME=".*"$/ZSH_THEME="biratime"/g' ~/.zshrc
sed -i 's/^plugins=(/plugins=(virtualenv /g' ~/.zshrc
```

4. **Enable the [solarized colors scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)** for your terminal

If you use Linux with the Gnome terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aruhier/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
./install.sh
```

If you use the Microsoft Terminal, you can enable solarized colors for the WSL terminal in the Settings window.

5. Use the **ZSH shell by default**:

```bash
sudo chsh --shell=/usr/bin/zsh $USER
```

6. Hide the default **conda environment** displayed to only show it with the ZSH theme:

```bash
echo "\`conda config --set changeps1 false\`" >> ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/virtualenv/virtualenv.plugin.zsh
```

## üê≥ Install in Docker

You can easily install this theme in a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
RUN sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
